    <section id="belief">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">ðŸ’­ What I Believe</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">I believe weâ€™re building in a world that doesnâ€™t yet know how to hold our full selves.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Most systems reward speed, compliance, and surface. But real creation â€” the kind that feels true in your body â€” doesnâ€™t happen that way. It requires space. Trust. Capacity. And tools that donâ€™t hijack your nervous system.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">I believe in making things that work with your humanity, not against it. That AI can be used without erasing your intuition. That clarity isnâ€™t just a cognitive state â€” itâ€™s a felt one. And that ambition doesnâ€™t have to come at the cost of your softness, your grief, or your boundaries.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Iâ€™ve spent years navigating high-pressure systems while trying to stay present in my own body. Iâ€™ve seen what happens when brilliance gets buried under burnout, perfectionism, or performance. Iâ€™ve also seen what becomes possible when the right tools, questions, and systems are in place â€” the kind that mirror you back to yourself instead of muting your signal.</p>
      <p class="mb-4 font-semibold">This is for the ones who feel everything. Who build anyway. And who are ready to create something real â€” without selling themselves out.</p>
